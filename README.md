### Project Description:
The Tax Bracket Calculator Application assignment provided a real world example that 
promoted JavaScript programming best practices in using methods, if/else
statements, and functions; and in declaring variables. Listed below in the 
*Lessons Learned in Assignment* section of this document are reflections on the
importance of examples and instructional guidance, reusable code, and practice 
in learning JavaScript programming.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. *The importance of examples and instructional guidance in JavaScript*
    *programming.*  The comments and examples provided in the Calcuator Tax
    Bracket Application assignment assisted my understanding of the application's 
    logic and code, thereby enhancing my ability to complete the requirements of the
    assignment as well as troubleshoot to ensure the application ran correctly.
    An important take-away from this assignment, provide an adequate amount of 
    comments in JavaScript coding projects I initiate and/or update for guidance 
    to others who may work on these projects in my absence.
   
2. *The importance of reusable code in JavaScript programming.*  Reusable code
    saves both time and space. For example, functions can be used over and over
    again, thus, saving coding time. Loops and iterations use less space and, 
    as such, make code easier to modify and maintain.

3. *The importance of practice.*  In lesson 5, the W3schools website, the online 
    interactive book *Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition*, and Interactive Js 
    lessons provided interactive exercises that facilitated my learning JavaScript 
    programming theory and enabled my understanding of the code and instructions 
    in the Caculator Tax Bracket Application assignment.
